## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the game up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Java Development Kit (JDK)

### Installing

To install JDK follow this link here: [Installing JDK](https://www.codejava.net/java-core/how-to-write-compile-and-run-a-hello-world-java-program-for-beginners).
This guide is really great and easy to follow with pictures as well. 

And for Eclipse, go to [Eclipse Packages](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/) and heres a [table](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/compare) comparing the packages.

You can always install more software to fit your needs later.
